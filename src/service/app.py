    #      that is in the "Production" stage.
    # 2. Fetch the necessary real-time features for a given driver from the
    #    Feast online store.
    #    - The request to this endpoint should probably include driver identifiers.
    #    - Use the Feast feature store client to get the latest feature vector.
    # 3. Use the loaded model to make a prediction with the features from Feast.
    # 4. Return the prediction result in a JSON response.
